## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# get and set working directory
getwd()
setwd("/Users/benjaminwasserman/Desktop/Chapman University/Senior/MGSC310/Final/MGSC310 Final")

# read in files
tourney_games <- read.csv("ConferenceTourneyGames.csv")
tourney_compact_results <- read.csv("NCAATourneyCompactResults.csv")
regular_season_compact_results <- read.csv("RegularSeasonCompactResults.csv")
seasons <- read.csv("Seasons.csv")
team_coaches <- read.csv("TeamCoaches.csv")
teams <- read.csv("Teams.csv")
team_conferences <- read.csv("TeamConferences.csv")
tourney_seeds <- read.csv("NCAATourneySeeds.csv")
tourney_detailed_result <- read.csv("NCAATourneyDetailedResults.csv")
regular_season_detailed_result <- read.csv("RegularSeasonDetailedResults.csv")
```

With this dataset we are trying to predict tournament winners. We will test on various years to try and obtain the most accurate results.

```{r}
# summary statistics
View(tourney_detailed_result)

```
